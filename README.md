# Torus-standalone

A standalone version of [Torus](https://github.com/Monchoman45/Torus), a Wikia chat client that isn't Special:Chat.

If you see a lack of credits to the original author of Torus, [Monchoman45](https://github.com/Monchoman45), in this program or it's documentation, please inform me because I was probably pushing this to GitHub too fast and forgot to give kudos to him.

**This project is not maintained anymore.** Code here has been kept as an archive of the work done on this project.
